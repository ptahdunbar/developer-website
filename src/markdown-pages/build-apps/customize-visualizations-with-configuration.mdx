<Intro>

This guide builds off of the previous <Link to="/build-apps/custom-visualizations-and-the-new-relic-one-sdk">Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK</Link> guide. If you haven't followed that guide, please start there as this guide assumes you have the code we built in that guide to get started. 

Following the previous guide, we've added the ability to switch between two charts types. Currently this is taking up some space in the visualization. That might be ok and we might want our users to have the choice to switch between two chart types at any point in the visualization lifecycle. If we only need our users to be able to select an option about our visualization once, when they are adding it to the dashboard, we can use the `coniguration` key in our visualization's nr1.json file. We are going to do just that, we will remove the `SegmentedControl` component and instead add a value to te `configuration` array.
